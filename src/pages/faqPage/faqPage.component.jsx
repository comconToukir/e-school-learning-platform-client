              Visit the course catalog to browse our offerings. In addition to
              searching by course duration and availability, you can also search
              by subject to ensure you find a course that reflects your
              interests. Though it is not required, we encourage those who have
              not studied art before to consider taking an art history course
              first to get a solid grounding in the discipline before exploring
              more specific disciplines. Our art history courses are the perfect
              first step before moving on to art market courses.

              There are no prerequisites. Our courses are open to students of
              all backgrounds who are 18 years of age and older. All courses are
              conducted in English. Video lectures include English subtitles and
              the option to slow-down, pause, or replay lectures for better
              retention. Discussion boards are a critical component of each of
              our courses; therefore, we suggest students have a conversational
              knowledge of English when pursuing a Certificate of Completion.
              For any of the art writing courses, students need to be 100%
              proficient in written English.

              Get your certificate: When you successfully complete an Online
              Course, you are eligible to receive a digital certificate of
              completion. We encourage you to review your instructor’s syllabus
              to understand the Certificate of Completion requirements for your
              course. These requirements often include the following:
              <br />
              <br />
              Active participation in the majority of discussion boards Timely
              submission of all assignments
              <br />
              <br />
              Most courses have 1-2 short written assignments, but it can vary
              and it is important for you to follow -up with your instructor
              early in the course should you have any questions or concerns
              regarding your eligibility or the requirements. Certificates of
              Completion are delivered to the email used at the time of
              registration, and can be expected no later than 3 weeks after the
              course ends. These digital verified credentials allow you to
              present a trustworthy record of your learning to anyone at any
